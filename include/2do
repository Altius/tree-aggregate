don't read in all tree models at one time during prediction.  Stick to some fixed number.
  consider making a 2mer instead of 4mer (Core structure) since it switches fields during
  'isleaf' or not-a-leaf.
generalize to string labels.
one major item that will speed up typical cases substantially is to exclude zeroes, even when including them.
  everything that is a zero will go in one bin or another, all together, and they can all be binned after all
  other non-zeroes have been arranged around a threshold.  Can still include 0 as a potential threshold when
  using BEST.
